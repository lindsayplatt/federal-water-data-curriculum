# Glossary

Terms used across the course, defined once. As pages are revised, the first use of each term on a page will link here. For example,
NOAA identifies a river reach by its {term}`COMID`, while USGS uses a {term}`monitoring location ID <Monitoring location ID>`.

To link a term from a page, use the MyST `term` role: `` {term}`COMID` ``, or `` {term}`reaches <Reach>` `` to show
different text. Add new terms to the section where they fit, keeping each section alphabetical.

## Shared concepts

Every data product in the course is introduced with these seven concepts (see the style guide's shared-concept table).

```{glossary}
Data quality flag(s)
: A value attached to a measurement that says how much to trust it. Examples: SWOT's `reach_q` and `wse_qual`,
  and USGS's approval status and qualifiers. NWM model output has no per-value quality flag.

Data unit
: What one "file" or record of a product is: a SWOT granule, one NWM output file per time step,
  or one USGS time series per monitoring location and parameter.

Location identifier
: The ID that says *where* a value applies: a SWOT `reach_id` or `node_id`, an NWM COMID (`feature_id`),
  or a USGS monitoring location ID such as `USGS-12200500`.

Time
: *When* a value applies, and how often values are produced: a SWOT overpass time, an NWM {term}`forecast reference time <Forecast reference time>`
  and {term}`valid time <Valid time>`, or a USGS timestamp (continuous or daily).

Variable
: *What* was measured or modeled, for example water surface elevation (SWOT), streamflow (NWM),
  or discharge and gage height (USGS).

Variable unit
: The units a variable is reported in, for example meters (SWOT water surface elevation), m³/s (NWM streamflow)
  or ft³/s (USGS discharge).

Version / provenance
: Which release of a product a value came from, and from where: a SWOT product version (e.g. `D`) and collection DOI,
  an NWM model version and configuration, or the USGS service and retrieval date.
```

## General data and code terms

```{glossary}
API
: Application programming interface. Here, a web service that returns data in response to a request URL,
  so code can retrieve data without a point-and-click website.

API key
: A personal token that identifies you to an API, often allowing higher request limits. Also called a token or
  personal access token (PAT); the USGS key goes in the `API_USGS_PAT` environment variable. Keep keys in environment
  variables, never in your code.

Conda environment
: An isolated set of Python packages, defined by a file such as `environments/m03-swot.yml`, so a lesson's code
  runs with known package versions.

CONUS
: The contiguous United States: the 48 adjoining states and the District of Columbia, without Alaska, Hawaii
  or the territories.

CRS
: Coordinate reference system: how coordinates map to places on Earth, for example longitude and latitude on the
  WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326) or a projected grid such as UTM. Data from different sources must share a CRS before you overlay them.

Discharge
: The volume of water flowing past a point per unit time, for example in ft³/s or m³/s. Also called streamflow.

DOI
: Digital Object Identifier: a permanent link (`https://doi.org/...`) to a dataset, paper or piece of software. Cite
  datasets by DOI where one exists, with the version and the date you accessed them.

Geoid
: The shape the ocean surface would take under gravity alone, extended under the land; the reference for heights
  "above sea level". SWOT water surface elevations are given relative to a geoid model (EGM2008).

Lead time
: How far ahead a forecast value is: its {term}`valid time <Valid time>` minus its
  {term}`forecast reference time <Forecast reference time>`.

Streamflow
: See {term}`Discharge`.

Virtual Zarr
: A small reference file that lets software read existing files (such as NetCDF) as if they were one Zarr
  dataset, fetching only the pieces needed from cloud storage. Built with tools such as {term}`kerchunk`.
```

## NASA SWOT

```{glossary}
Cycle and pass
: SWOT's orbit repeats every 21 days; each repeat is a *cycle*. Within a cycle, each numbered *pass* is one
  half-orbit (ascending or descending). A place on the ground is seen by one or more passes per cycle.

earthaccess
: A Python library for logging in to NASA Earthdata and searching, downloading or streaming NASA data granules.

Granule
: The smallest unit of data NASA distributes for a product, usually one file. For SWOT, one granule covers one
  stretch of one satellite pass: a whole continent for RiverSP, one scene for the Raster product.

hydrocron
: A PO.DAAC web API that returns time series of SWOT river reach and node data (and lake data) as CSV or GeoJSON,
  without downloading whole granules.

KaRIn
: The Ka-band Radar Interferometer, SWOT's main instrument. It measures the height of water surfaces across two
  swaths, one on each side of the satellite's path.

Node
: A point about every 200 m along a SWORD reach. SWOT river data are reported for nodes and reaches.

Pixel cloud (PIXC)
: SWOT's lower-level product of individual radar pixels classified as water or land, with their heights. The river
  ({term}`RiverSP`) and {term}`Raster <SWOT Raster product>` products are built from it.

PO.DAAC
: NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center, which distributes SWOT data.

Product description document (PDD)
: The technical document for one SWOT product and version, defining every variable, unit and quality flag.
  Check it before interpreting a flag value.

Reach
: A river segment. In SWOT data, a reach is a segment of about 10 km defined in SWORD (`reach_id`). In the NWM, a reach
  is an NHDPlus segment with its own COMID, often much shorter. The two networks are separate and don't match one to one.

RiverSP
: SWOT's River Single-Pass Vector product: one record per {term}`reach <Reach>` (or {term}`node <Node>`) per
  overpass, with water surface elevation, width, slope, discharge and quality flags. Collection short names
  look like `SWOT_L2_HR_RiverSP_reach_D`.

Science orbit
: SWOT's 21-day repeat orbit, used since 2023 for routine observations. It followed a 1-day repeat
  calibration ("fast-sampling") orbit used after launch.

SWORD
: The SWOT River Database: a global river network, built before launch, that defines the reaches and nodes
  SWOT river measurements are mapped to.

SWOT
: The Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission (NASA and CNES), which measures water surface elevation,
  width and extent of rivers and lakes from space.

SWOT Raster product
: A gridded SWOT product (100 m or 250 m UTM grid) with water surface elevation, water area and water fraction
  per cell, for one scene of one pass. Collection short names look like `SWOT_L2_HR_Raster_100m_D`.

Water surface elevation
: The height of the water surface above a reference surface. SWOT reports it in meters (`wse`), relative to a
  {term}`geoid <Geoid>` model (EGM2008; see the Meet NASA SWOT page).
```

## NOAA NWM

```{glossary}
COMID
: Common Identifier: the unique numeric ID of a stream reach in the NHDPlus network. In the contiguous U.S. (CONUS),
  NWM's `feature_id` values are the same numbers.

Configuration
: One of the NWM's standard model runs, for example `short_range`, `medium_range`, `long_range`
  or `analysis_assim`, each with its own length (forecast horizon or lookback) and issue schedule.

Data assimilation
: Adjusting a model while it runs so it stays close to observations. The NWM analysis configuration
  assimilates USGS streamflow observations, among others.

Ensemble member
: One of several runs of the same forecast with slightly different inputs. The NWM medium-range forecast has
  six members; their spread is a rough guide to forecast uncertainty.

feature_id
: NWM's name for a reach identifier. In CONUS it is the same number as the NHDPlus {term}`COMID`.

Forcing
: The weather inputs that drive a hydrologic model, such as precipitation, temperature and radiation.

Forecast reference time
: When an NWM forecast was issued (UTC). Also called the reference time. Each forecast value also has a
  {term}`valid time <Valid time>`.

hydrotools
: A Python package from NOAA's Office of Water Prediction for retrieving NWM output (including past forecasts)
  and other hydrologic data as `pandas` DataFrames.

kerchunk
: A Python library that builds reference files describing where each variable sits inside existing files
  (such as NWM NetCDF files), so `xarray` can read only the parts it needs from cloud storage.

NHDPlus
: The National Hydrography Dataset Plus: a geospatial dataset of the U.S. stream network, broken into reaches
  each with a COMID. The NWM runs on this network.

NLDI
: The Network Linked Data Index, a USGS web service that links features such as monitoring locations to NHDPlus
  reaches (COMIDs) and navigates up- or downstream along the network.

NODD
: NOAA Open Data Dissemination, the program that publishes NOAA data, including NWM output, on commercial
  clouds such as AWS and Google Cloud.

NOMADS
: NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System, a NOAA server that keeps the most recent NWM output
  (about the last two days).

NWM
: The National Water Model, NOAA's hydrologic model that simulates and forecasts streamflow for millions of
  river reaches across the United States.

Retrospective simulation
: A long NWM run over historical weather, used for reach-level streamflow records where there is no gage.
  It is a simulation, not archived forecasts.

Valid time
: The time an NWM forecast value applies to (UTC). Valid time minus reference time is the forecast's lead time.
```

## USGS WDFN

```{glossary}
Approval status
: Whether a USGS value is provisional (subject to revision) or approved (reviewed and final).

Continuous values
: USGS sensor values recorded at a fixed interval, typically every 15 minutes. Also called instantaneous values.

Daily values
: USGS values summarized per day, most often the daily mean (statistic code, `statistic_id`, `00003`).

dataretrieval
: A USGS Python package for retrieving USGS water data. Its modernized `waterdata` module uses the
  USGS Water Data APIs; the legacy `nwis` module uses the older services.

Field measurement
: A direct measurement of discharge (or gage height) made by USGS staff at a monitoring location,
  used to build and check the rating curve.

Gage datum
: The local reference level that {term}`gage height <Gage height>` is measured from at a monitoring location. It is
  chosen for each site, so gage heights from different sites (or a gage height and a satellite elevation) can't be
  compared without converting to a common vertical datum.

Gage height
: The height of the water surface above a local reference point (the gage datum) at a monitoring location.
  Also called stage.

Monitoring location ID
: The USGS identifier for a place where data are collected, such as `USGS-12200500`.

NWIS
: The National Water Information System, the USGS database behind WDFN. Its older website and web services
  (NWISWeb, WaterServices) are being retired.

Parameter code
: A five-digit USGS code for a variable, for example `00060` for discharge and `00065` for gage height.

Provisional data
: Recent USGS data that have not yet been reviewed and approved, and can change.

Qualifier
: A remark attached to an individual USGS value, for example `ESTIMATED` when ice affected the gage. In
  `dataretrieval` output it is the `qualifier` column, often empty.

Rating curve
: The relationship between gage height and discharge at a monitoring location, fitted to field measurements.
  USGS computes continuous discharge from gage height with it.

Streamgage
: A monitoring location on a stream or river that records {term}`gage height <Gage height>` continuously and
  reports discharge computed from it.

WDFN
: Water Data for the Nation, the USGS website and APIs that publish USGS water data (data stored in NWIS).
